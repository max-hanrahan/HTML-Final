<h1>Starting a Podcast, Maybe...</h1><img src ="mic.jpg"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Last summer, my brother Nate Hanrahan and my good friend Jonah Britton joked about starting a podcast. Well, now we've gotten more serious about it. We have plans to launch a relaxed, three-dudes-talking style like <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm" target="_blank">Hello Internet</a> or <a href="https://www.benbenandblue.com" target="_blank">Ben, Ben, and Blue</a>. We'll link you to our first episode here, once it comes out.</p> <br/>
<h1>I'm in a Band Now</h1><img src="image2.JPG"><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, actually, I've been practicing and involved in the writing process for about a year now, but our first show has finally taken place! We are Sounds Like A Plan (conveniently abreviate-able as S.L.A.P.), and you can <a href="http://192.168.168.251/blocked/restricted.html?fn=Students+OU&fp=3&bu=youtube.com&bc=Website+is+part+of+blocklist.&ip=10.219.1.35&ibip=192.168.168.252" target="_blank">watch our first show on YouTube.</a> 
<br/>Our band is a unique blend of punk, prog, jazz, and R&B. My brother and I have teamed up with vocalist Robert Fox, supplying our guitar skills alongside bassist Blake Peterson and drummer Mike Wolfe. We're on a mission to save Erie's disintegrating music scene, and we'll be playing a lot of shows soon. Next stop: <u>January 12 at Basement Transmissions</u>. Be there!</p> <br/>
<h1>My Cross Country Experience</h1>    <img src="EHSXC/sv1.jpg"><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Five years ago, I had no athletic ability whatsoever. I needed a hobby and a resume stuffer, so I decided to try out cross country. It was a difficult transition, and I think my first 5k took me 39 minutes to complete. Fast forward to today: I have stayed on the varsity team for three straight years, recieved the "Most Dedicated Teammate" award twice, and served as the <b>first ever team captain of the Erie High Royals.</b></p> <br/>
<p>That reminds me, the cross country banquet video is now up! Click <a href="https://youtu.be/_dEfKgxBlPI">here</a> to watch this year's video presentation and <a href="https://youtu.be/TSzRFOef4Ew">here</a> to watch last year's.
<h1>I am now a QuestBridge Finalist!</h1>
    
    <img src="Blag/questbridge.png">
    <p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may hop on here just to humblebrag, I have accomplisghed something rare and prestigious. In 2017, only 5759 applicants became National College Match Finalists, out of 15606 applicants. Although I wasn't among the lucky few to be "matched" (which is what I was hoping for), it is still something that I am particularly proud of. This is one of the greatest achievements that I have ever accomplished, and I just want to thank my family, my classmates, and my teachers for helping me garnish this rare opportunity.</p> <br/>
