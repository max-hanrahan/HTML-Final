    <h1>My Musical Journey</h1><img src="image1.JPG"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I did anything musical was in first grade, when I begged my parents to pay for violin lessons for me. First thing I learned in that account: violin is <i>hard.</i> I'm glad I stuck with it though, at least for a few years, because that has helped me quite a bit in terms of music theory. A few years after I quit solo violin lessons, I took up the guitar, completely casually, not really expecting to get too much out of it. I'm not studying guitar professionally, I can't call myself a professional musician on any account, but music has given me something to do for leisure, and I don't know what I would do without it.</p><br/>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reminds me, I'm one of the guitarists for the new band Sounds Like A Plan. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNWENmU1H-ATp-7FVBF6Wugw6GjRdR2Cw">here</a> and we'll share our first live performance with you.</p><br/><br/><br/>
    
    <h1>What I Listen To</h1><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have it narrowed down to a pie chart:</p><br/><br/><br/><img src="pie.PNG"><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>As you can see, I spend about half of my time listening to Progressive Rock, a third of my time listening to alt and assosciated genres, and the remaining sixth to basically anything else! Although it's typically musical theatre, it can be basically anything.</p>
    <h1>S.L.A.P. Influences</h1><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diverse band, it's fairly difficult to pin us down as a single genre or influenced by one artist or style in particular. But as Rob does the bulk of the songwriting here, I think it's fair to say that our music exists in the vein of some of his favorite bands, such as Dance Gavin Dance, A Lot Like Birds, etc. But you could describe us as a pop-punk band and it still wouldn't be far from the truth. Point is, genres are dumb and we should try to listen to music more and justify it less. Go give us a listen!</p>
