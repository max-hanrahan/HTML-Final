    <h1>Academic Background</h1>
 <img src="Blag/24019977_821604681377386_913741264_n.jpg">
    <p>I am a senior at Collegiate Academy. I am in the top 15% of my class, and have participated in National Honor Society (Scholarship Committee), Peer Tutoring, Latin club, the PA Junior Academy of Sciences, Math Club, and Mathematical Proofs Club. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsoJdWtGBtUnmMtFyYNDA6bbrZaJuG3mpEXr8lBXIoo/edit">here</a> to see my full resume. <br/>I have applied to sixteen colleges and universities (which is way too many, apply to eight at the most, seniors!), and as of now, I've heard back from <b>seven</b>. Gannon, Penn State, Kent State, Edinboro, and Mercyhurst all admitted me, Colorado College deferred me, and the University of Chicago denied me. </p><br/> 
        <br/><p>Honestly, I'm not too surprised (or sad) about that last one.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>I am also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuestBridge">QuestBridge Finalist</a>, which was part of my motivation to apply to so many colleges. No matter where I go, I hope to use my passion for mathematics to better the world through the art of problem solving.</p>
