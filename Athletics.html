    <h1>Athletic Achievements</h1><img src="EHSXC/DSC_1918.jpg"><p>The first sport I took up was Tae Kwon Do, when I was in third grade...I think.<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> I advanced to Blue Belt and was about halfway through advancing to Violet before lessons became too expensive. For a few years, I didn't do much other than feel generally sad, so I decided to take up cross country. That decision was quite a defining moment for me. At first, I could hardly run three miles, but over the course of five years, I have built up the stamina for a personal record of 19:53 for a 5k. Along the way, I was able to win two "most dedicated team member awards" and serve as the <b><u>first ever captain of the EHS Royals.</u></b></p></br></br></br>

<p>I would recommend running to everyone because the opportunity cost is so low, and the benefits are so high. At first it may feel like exercise, and well, it is, but stick with it, and I promise that you'll see what I mean. It's an individual sport, which means that your only opponent is yourself. If you experience some measure of personal growth, that's all that matters. But aside from the obvious health benefits, running will help clear your mind. It'll give you a high like you wouldn't believe too, and you don't even have to pay anybody. All you need is 30min of your time, some headphones, and preferably a nice, woodsy spot with lots of free sunlight and oxygen (plus a water bottle if you wanna go bananas).</p><br/><br/>

<p>And don't worry if you don't experience a holy sensation on the first day. Sometimes this just takes time, but please, do stick with it and it will change your life.</p>
